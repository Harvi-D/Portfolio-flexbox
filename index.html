                    <h2>Hi everybody!</h2>
                    <p>My name is Dylan Harville— I'm currently a student in <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful's</a>
                    software engineering program. I'm based in Salt Lake City, UT, and excited to get to work in software development.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am dedicated to producing beautiful, functional and intuitive websites and applications. Although my journey in 
                    programming was started fairly recently, each step along the way has been met with determination, a passion for problem
                    solving and creativity. Check out my <a href="#projects">projects</a> and reach out if you like what you see!

            <div class="group">
                <div class="item">
                    <p>Since I first started building my abilities in web and software development, I have found myself passionate and excited about
                    implementing my talents in a proffesional setting. I am eager to pursue my passion with a like-minded team, and to have
                    the opportunity to continue building and focusing my skills. I hope to be able to collaborate with creative developers to produce 
                    applications that are clean, functional and well-maintained. My education has not only given me the information I 
                    need to excel in this field, but has also provided me with tools to improve how I 
                    perceive and approach challenges. My functional understanding of user interface design, data managment, and 
                    application maintainance would make me a valuble asset to your team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I keep my motivation and creativity sharp by exploring outside, spacifically in the deserts of Southern Utah— it's a great place to 
                    hone my astrophotography skills and collect striking mineral specimens. My life-long love of video games and sci-fi was one of the major 
                    contributors to my interest in computers and programming. When I'm not behind my desk working, I can usually be found playing retro
                    games or reading books by Isaac Asimov.
